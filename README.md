## General info
This directory is part of a set of directories that aim to contribute to developing the "Platform for analytical models in epidemiology" (PAMEpi).  The work produced here aims to grab all data related to infectious diseases analysed in the platform. Among them are data over a range of individual infectious status, socio-economic and human behaviour. 

We will integrate health and social-economic determinants data that are available for each of the 5570 Brazilian cities. Additionally, we will jointly assess information about the implemented interventions and social mobility patterns. The harmonised data at the municipal level will be a foundational resource enabling the application/development of statistical analysis, nonlinear mathematical modelling, computational modelling, data visualisation and scientific dissemination about the infectious diseases that mainly affect Brazil. 

At the moment, we are focusing on the studies of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. The studies are part of the  Grand Challenges ICODA COVID-19 Data Science (2021-2022), supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Minderoo Foundation with HDR UK reference number 2021.0097, and the Fiocruz Innovation Promotion Program - INOVA-FIOCRUZ (2020-2021), Innovative ideas and products for the COVID-19 with reference number VPPIS-005-FIO-20-2-40.


## Compilation

The directory is divided into Data collection, Data curation and Data formatting folders, representing the process applied to the datasets used. Inside of each folder, we specify the disease we are working on. Finally, an example is shown for the Brazilian Covid 19 big data workflow.
